Semantic HTML5 Elements

Semantic HTML5 elements are HTML tags that clearly describe the meaning and purpose of the content they contain. Unlike generic elements such as <div> and <span>, semantic elements provide meaningful structure to a webpage. This helps browsers, search engines, developers, and assistive technologies understand the content better.

Using semantic HTML improves accessibility, search engine optimization (SEO), and code readability, making applications easier to maintain and scale.

Common Semantic HTML5 Elements

<header>
The <header> element represents introductory content for a page or section. It typically contains the site logo, title, headings, or navigation links. A page can have multiple headers, but each should relate to its surrounding content.

<nav>
The <nav> element is used to define a block of navigation links. It usually contains menus, links to different pages, or internal section links. Screen readers use this element to identify navigation areas easily.

<main>
The <main> element represents the primary content of the document. It should be unique and must not be repeated on the same page. This helps assistive technologies quickly locate the main content.

<article>
The <article> element is used for independent, self-contained content such as blog posts, news articles, or forum posts. Content inside an article should make sense even if it is viewed separately.

<section>
The <section> element groups related content under a common theme. It usually includes a heading and is used to organize content logically within a page or article.

<aside>
The <aside> element contains content that is indirectly related to the main content, such as sidebars, related links, advertisements, or author information.

<footer>
The <footer> element represents the footer of a page or section. It commonly includes copyright information, social media links, author details, or related documents.

<figure> and <figcaption>
The <figure> element is used to group visual content such as images, diagrams, or charts. The <figcaption> provides a descriptive caption for the content inside the figure, improving accessibility and clarity.

Interview-Ready Summary

Semantic HTML5 elements provide meaningful structure to web pages. They improve accessibility for screen readers, enhance SEO, and make code more readable and maintainable. Using semantic tags is a best practice in modern web development and is preferred over excessive use of generic <div> elements.
